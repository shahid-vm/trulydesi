The story behind our brand is that of love, care, and the need to do the right thing.\n\nSeven years ago, as her young daughter battled a disease caused by adulterated milk, Rupali Kakade (Founder. Truly Desi) was frantically surfing the internet to find out from where major dairy brands were sourcing their milk. What she realized was that most big brands did not make their sources known publicly-which raised questions in her mind. Meanwhile, her daughter's condition was getting worse. She decided to buy cows for her farm in Junnar for milk and dairy products. It worked and thus she went on to set up Truly Desi to bring farm fresh, adulteration-free dairy products to a market that lacked such options.",
